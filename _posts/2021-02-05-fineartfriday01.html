<p>Happy Friday! I have been working on a lot of new artistic projects this week, and I thought it would be fun to start a "Fine Art Friday" tradition here on the blog. Currently, I have been making a lot of animated gifs (as you can see scattered around the site)! I finally got a Cricut machine and I am really excited to start learning how to make stickers, which has also prompted the grand opening of our <a href="/shop.html">shop</a>!</p>

<p>Please stop by and check it out when you get the chance. There are limited supplies of current items, but I would love to hear any feedback you have on what items you would like to see more or less of in the shop. There are only two sticker options available at the moment as I figure out my Cricut, but please check back frequently if you are interested in more styles. I will be designing more! I also have a sweatshirt available, with more clothing options also coming soon.</p>
