<p>Happy Friday! I have been so busy getting to work with my Cricut machine, planning and dreaming about the upcoming additions to the farm, and quilting that I haven't been posting much. However, I did want to share some of the things I have been sketching. Maybe it's because bee season is just around the corner, or maybe I just have bugs on the brain, but beekeeping equipment has been floating around my brain recently and showing up a lot in my art.</p>

<p>Featured this week is a little sketch I've been working on featuring some items that make me think of the bees (except the onion... I'm honestly not sure why I drew that, but oh well). Next week I'll be getting back into the groove with regular hive inspections, so stay tuned for some posts about what to look for during hive inspections and how to make springtime splits!</p>

<p>Thanks for following along this week.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
